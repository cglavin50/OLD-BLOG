      <description>This is my first post on this site, so I&amp;rsquo;m going to cover what I&amp;rsquo;ve learned about Hugo.
What is Hugo? Hugo is a web-development framework that runs in Go, translating markdown documents to HTML, adding community-built themes to provide CSS styling. All in all, it gives us a great package to set up and run a static webpage. While there are a ton of options out there (many built on JS), Hugo has a wide variety of tools for developing a more complex site (including API-driven content and customization), as well as incredibly fast build times.</description>

&lt;p&gt;Hugo is a web-development framework that runs in Go, translating markdown documents to HTML, adding community-built themes to provide CSS styling. All in all, it gives us a great package to set up and run a static webpage. While there are a ton of options out there (many built on JS), Hugo has a wide variety of tools for developing a more complex site (including API-driven content and customization), as well as incredibly fast build times. I chose Hugo as I couldn&amp;rsquo;t resist a web-builder framework built in Go, and it&amp;rsquo;s plug-and-play themes made it an easy way to start this project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-do-i-update-this-site&#34;&gt;How do I update this site?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m still learning Hugo, so these are some notes before I forget how to deploy a new post. First of all, I&amp;rsquo;m hosting everything in my &amp;ldquo;blog&amp;rdquo; github repo, however the deployment is the actual GitHub pages repo. Hugo -t terminal builds the site pages with the theme terminal, which then directs all the output to the submodule pages repo. That way, I can run hugo server -t terminal, building the pages and getting a local run to make sure everything looks great and I can commit these changes. I locally installed the theme, so won&amp;rsquo;t worry about updating that (recommendation course of action is through Github actions). Posts are created with hugo new posts/postname, and other pages (ex about, links, etc) are all created/stored in the contents subdirectory. Hugo has set styling for the markdown pages that I&amp;rsquo;m still figuring out, so far now it is a copy-and-paste affair, coupled with the md formatting I already know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;whats-next&#34;&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s next?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, as I plan to do this daily I should likely schedule a cron job for commiting and updating the respective repos. I need to figure out where to locally store images so I can make my about page reflect me, and finish developing out the core of the website (about page, links, portfolio, menu), and keep writing!&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>Who am I? I am an undergraduate at Georgetown University, pursuing a B.S. in Computer Science, and a minor in Mathematics, graduating in May 2024. Passionate about problem-solving, networking, and developing an easy-access internet for all, I love to learn and am always looking to find new tech to dive into.
What do I do? I am currently involved with anti-censorship research involving new network protocols on campus, and am a backend developer who enjoys learning web-dev on the side.</description>

&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-do-i-do&#34;&gt;What do I do?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am currently involved with anti-censorship research involving new network protocols on campus, and am a backend developer who enjoys learning web-dev on the side. I love to code, and have been diving into Go recently as my language of choice, however am also interested in deployments and devops.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;goals&#34;&gt;Goals&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I love to learn, I wanted to create this page as a blog post, where I intend to write one article covering something new I learned, every day. That way, I hold myself accountable, and I can use this as a place to refer back to when I want to build off something I remember from a previous review day.&lt;/p&gt;
